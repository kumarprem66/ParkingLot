Parking Lot
Design and implement a car parking system in Java that can accommodate different types of vehicles and
supports a configurable cost strategy. The system should support the following functionalities:
1. Initialize the parking lot with a given number of floors and car spaces per floor.
2. Add vehicle details to the parking lot, including the vehicle type (car, sports car, truck, bus),
registration number and any other necessary attributes.
3. Remove a vehicle from the parking lot based on the registration number or parking slot number.
4. Check the availability of vehicle spaces on a specific floor for a given vehicle type.
You should implement the following classes:
1. ParkingLot: Represents the parking lot and manages vehicle spaces.
2. Vehicle: Represents a vehicle with attributes such as vehicle type, registration number, color, and
any other necessary attributes.
3. Floor: Represents a floor in the parking lot with attributes like floor number, capacity for each
vehicle type, and vehicle spaces.
4. VehicleSpace: Represents a vehicle space with attributes such as space number, availability,
vehicle type, and any other necessary attributes.
5. CostStrategy: Represents the cost strategy for parking, allowing for varying costs based on the
vehicle type and supporting different currencies.
You are free to design and implement any additional classes, methods, or data structures as needed to
solve the problem.
Instructions:
1. Write the Java code to implement the car parking system.
2. Implement the required functionalities mentioned above.
3. Use a main class to demonstrate the usage of the parking lot and its methods.
4. Test your code with multiple scenarios and edge cases.
Please organize your code into appropriate packages and classes. Your main class should include the
following methods:
1. Init : Initializes the parking lot with the given number of floors and vehicle spaces per floor for
each vehicle type.
2. addVehicle : Adds a vehicle of the specified type with the given registration number and color to
the parking lot.
3. removeVehicle : Removes the vehicle with the specified registration number from the parking lot.
4. checkAvailability : Checks the availability of vehicle spaces on the specified floor for the given
vehicle type.
Flat cost structure
● Bike per hour ₹ 10
● Car / Jeep per hour ₹ 20
● Bus / Truck per hour ₹ 30
Use case which should be covered
1. Initializing the Parking Lot for 2 Cars.
2. Enter 2 card details with timestamp value , should generate a token id for each car
3. This token can be used to take the car out of the parking lot. We should be able to call a method
where we pass the token id and timestamp value and the system should tell if the token is
correct. If the token is correct we should be able to get car details along with the total amount for
the parking fee.
4. Once the capacity is full, i.e. if we have 2 cars already in the parking lot, if we try to enter the next
car. It should throw an error.wish to add a new type of vehicle or a new cost strategy, then the
code change is minimum.
Submit your completed Java code along with any supporting documents or explanations.
Duration : 3 hours
Expectation :
1. The Java code project should have a main method.
2. There should be a way to initialize the configuration ( total capacity, total floor, different type of
vehicle, type of currency user, per vehicle per hour/per day charges ).
3. Also we should be able to enter the vehicle in the car parking and should take out the car by
either car number or token number whichever you prefer.
4. On full capacity, the system should print an error message which should be simple to understand.
